            <p class = "para">Goal of this Project: Our goal is to implement a working advice service, in which you can rate your work day on a scale of 1(worst) - 10(best), as well as include comments about your work day. The advice will then generate ways to celebrate, make yourself feel better, various self care regimens, etc. We want to improve employee wellness by allowing for them to log in their daily ratings and emotions in order to receive advice on how to better their day after work.
